                <h4>The Woman Who Outruns the Men, 200 Miles at a Time</h4>
                <p>Courtney Dauwalter specializes in extremely long races. But her success in winning them has opened a
                    debate about how men’s innate strength advantages apply to endurance sports.</p>
                <p>She saw live puppets playing on a swing set on the side of the trail. Trees and rocks turned into
                    faces. </p>
                <p>She was on her second night without sleep, 165 miles into a 205-mile race through the mountains,
                    pushing her body to levels considered physically impossible not long ago, and seeing very strange
                    things in the night.</p>
